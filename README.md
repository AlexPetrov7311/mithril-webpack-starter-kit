This repository is an example of project that makes use of said technologies.



## Stack Overview

* [**Webpack**](https://webpack.github.io/): Allows each asset in a project to be used as a JavaScript module. This includes not only JavaScript and TypeScript files, but also SCSS are supported with the provided configuration.
* [**Mithril**](mithril.js.org): A minimal JavaScript MVC library that provides React-like templating.
* [**TypeScript**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): A superset of JavaScript. It brings features that compliment large code bases such as [static typing](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/basic-types.html) and [interfaces](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/interfaces.html).
* [**Sass (SCSS)**](http://sass-lang.com/): A popular superset of CSS that makes it easier to write modular styles and brings features such as [variables](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#variables_) and [mixins](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#mixins). Additionally this project uses [*PostCSS*](http://postcss.org/) with [*autoprefixer*](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer).
